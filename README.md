## Usage 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> * When you launch the application, you will have to navigate to the photoFormAction.js file in the reducers folder in the components folder
> * There, you will see a variable named `const API_KEY = ""`
> * You will have to generate your own from this [website](https://api.nasa.gov/) and insert it in that variable. 
> * It is very important you do not push your fork if it is both public and has your API_KEY visible. 
> * You can also use the DEMO_KEY they give you, but this is limited to 30 calls an hour versus 1000 for free with API_KEY
